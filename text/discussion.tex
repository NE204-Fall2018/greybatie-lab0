Calibrating a gamma ray spectrum is vital for observing
and measuring any gamma radiation field. From the data
provided, a simple linear fit between 59.541 keV and 661.657 keV
has shown to be sufficiently accurate.

For future work and improvement upon this energy calibration, more than
two peaks could have been used to determine the parameters of linear
calibration, or a higher order polynomial regression method.
